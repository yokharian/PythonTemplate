# Contributing

This repository does not want to accept external contributions. If you have any questions or need assistance, please reach out to the maintainers via email or other means provided on the project's website.

If you still wish to contribute, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes. However, it is recommended that you first discuss your idea with the maintainers to ensure that your contribution aligns with the project's goals and values.

We appreciate any contributions made by users who are interested in improving the project, but we also respect the autonomy of the maintainers and do not want to impose our vision on others. We believe in a collaborative environment where everyone can contribute their expertise and ideas, as long as they follow the established guidelines and rules of the project.

We highly encourage you to fork the repository and reuse my template. This will allow you to modify the code to suit your needs without affecting the original version.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
